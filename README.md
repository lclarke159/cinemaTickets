# cinemaTickets
QA Consulting Pre Assessment Day Pack Task 2 submission by Lewis Clarke.

A console based java script for a prototype cinema system that provide the ability to purchase tickets and return the total
price of a customerâ€™s order.

There were still a couple of things that I would have prefered to have completed on this project before submission:

*Automatically recognising the day of the week instead of relying on user input.

*Adding restictions on tickets being purchased i.e. no children's tickets for a film rated 18.
